Many explanations of Jetpack around the internet are not simple enough.
They involve a little bit of complexity that a beginner may have difficult time to grasp the basic 
concept. That is why to explain the concept in very bare-bones way, I have chosen to use a simple example of 
addition of two numbers. 

The explanation of Jetpack components is in their respective branches.
If you do not have any info about Jetpacks and you are just starting then the recommended order is
as follows : 

1. Basic_concept_of_ViewModel
2. Basic_concept_of_ViewBinding
3. Basic_concept_of_LiveData
